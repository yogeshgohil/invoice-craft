Okay, I will review the login flow based on the current code implementation.

1.  **User navigates to `/login`:**
    *   The `LoginPage` component (`src/app/login/page.tsx`) renders.
    *   It checks the `isLoggedIn` state from `AuthContext`. If the user is somehow already logged in (e.g., valid cookie/localStorage exists from a previous session), the `useEffect` hook should redirect them to `/invoices`.
2.  **User enters credentials and clicks Login:**
    *   The `handleSubmit` function in `LoginPage` is called.
    *   It calls the `login(username, password)` function from `AuthContext`.
3.  **`AuthContext.login` executes:**
    *   It compares the provided `username` and `password` against the hardcoded `VALID_USERNAME` and `VALID_PASSWORD`.
    *   **If credentials match:**
        *   It sets the `isLoggedIn` state to `true` and updates the `username` state within the context.
        *   It attempts to save the auth state (`{ isLoggedIn: true, username: user }`) to `localStorage`.
        *   It sets the `app_auth_state` cookie with the same auth state, ensuring `path=/`.
        *   It returns `true` to the `handleSubmit` function.
    *   **If credentials do NOT match:**
        *   It returns `false`.
4.  **`handleSubmit` continues (Success Case):**
    *   Since `login` returned `true`, it shows the "Login Successful" toast.
    *   Crucially, it **does not** call `router.push` or `router.replace` directly here anymore.
5.  **State Update Triggers `useEffect` in `LoginPage`:**
    *   The `isLoggedIn` state within `AuthContext` has changed to `true`.
    *   The `useEffect` hook within `LoginPage` depends on `[isLoggedIn, router]`. Since `isLoggedIn` changed, the effect runs.
    *   Inside the effect, it checks `if (isLoggedIn)`. Since it's now `true`, it executes `router.replace('/invoices')`.
6.  **Navigation to `/invoices`:**
    *   The browser attempts to navigate to `/invoices`.
7.  **Middleware intercepts the request to `/invoices`:**
    *   The middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) runs.
    *   It reads the `app_auth_state` cookie (which should have been set in step 3).
    *   It parses the cookie and determines `isAuthenticated` is `true`.
    *   Since the user is authenticated and accessing `/invoices` (a protected route), the middleware allows the request using `NextResponse.next()`.
8.  **`/invoices` page loads:**
    *   The `InvoicesPage` component (`src/app/invoices/page.tsx`) renders.

**Conclusion based on review:**

The flow appears logically sound. The redirection is now handled by the `useEffect` hook reacting to the state change in the `AuthContext`, which is a standard pattern. The middleware correctly checks the cookie set by the context upon successful login to authorize access to protected routes.

If the redirect is still failing after the "Login Successful" toast appears:

1.  **Check Browser Console:** Look for any errors during the `router.replace('/invoices')` call or any subsequent errors when trying to load the `/invoices` page.
2.  **Check Middleware Logs:** Verify the console logs within `src/middleware.ts` to confirm it's correctly reading the cookie and determining `isAuthenticated = true` when the request for `/invoices` comes through after login.
3.  **Check Network Tab:** Ensure the request to `/invoices` is actually being made after the login attempt and check its status code.
4.  **`AuthContext` State:** Add temporary `console.log` inside the `AuthContext` `useEffect` that monitors `isLoggedIn` to be absolutely sure the state is updating as expected after login.

Based on the code, the mechanism for redirecting after a successful login via the `useEffect` hook is correctly implemented.
